  {
    q: "Is OpenServiceBus production-ready?",
    a: (
      <>
        No - it's designed for local development, unit tests, and CI. Use the real
        Azure Service Bus in production. OpenServiceBus's positioning is "real AMQP
        1.0 behavior without the Docker + SQL Server + EULA overhead."
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Does it work with Azure Functions?",
    a: (
      <>
        Yes. The repo ships an integration test (M11) that boots a real
        isolated-worker Functions app with a <code>ServiceBusTrigger</code> pointed
        at an OpenServiceBus instance, then asserts 100 messages flow trigger →
        handler → complete.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Which SDKs / languages does it support?",
    a: (
      <>
        The .NET <code>Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus</code> SDK is verified end-to-end.
        Because OpenServiceBus speaks real AMQP 1.0, the Java / Python / JS SDKs
        should work too - they're just not part of CI yet. Cross-language coverage
        is on the roadmap.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Where does the data live?",
    a: (
      <>
        In-memory by default - gone on restart, perfect for tests. Set{" "}
        <code>OpenServiceBus:Storage:Mode=Sqlite</code> for SQLite-backed
        persistence that survives a restart.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "What about sessions, TTL, scheduled messages, and DLQ?",
    a: <>All four are supported. Same APIs you'd use against real Service Bus.</>,
  },
  {
    q: "Is the Explorer UI included?",
    a: (
      <>
        Yes. The Docker image bundles a web Explorer on port <code>5400</code> -
        browse queues, send messages, peek the DLQ, manage subscriptions. The same
        Explorer runs against either OpenServiceBus or the real Azure broker.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "How does it differ from the Microsoft emulator?",
    a: (
      <>
        MIT-licensed (no EULA), ~50&nbsp;MB Alpine image (no SQL Edge), embeddable
        as a NuGet test fixture, sub-second cold start. See the comparison table
        on the home page for the full breakdown.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use it in CI/CD?",
    a: (
      <>
        Yes - it's a primary use case. Either spin up the Docker image in a
        service container, or use the <code>OpenServiceBus.Testing</code> NuGet
        fixture for an in-process broker your tests can talk to directly.
