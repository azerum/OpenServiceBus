# Docker

The OpenServiceBus container image is multi-stage Alpine, runs as a non-root user, and
ships the **broker AND the Explorer UI** in one image. SQLite-backed by default so
messages survive container recreates when you mount a volume.

## Pull

```bash
docker pull mauritsarissen/openservicebus:latest
# or, equivalently, from GHCR
docker pull ghcr.io/mauritsarissen/openservicebus:latest
```

Both registries are kept in sync by the release pipeline. Docker Hub is the recommended
default.

## Ports

| Port   | Protocol       | Service           | When                                                              |
| ------ | -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `5672` | AMQP           | Broker            | Always exposed — Service Bus SDK + AMQPNetLite clients            |
| `5300` | HTTP           | Management API    | Always exposed — REST CRUD + `/health`                            |
| `5400` | HTTP           | **Explorer UI**   | Always exposed — open <http://localhost:5400> in a browser        |
| `5673` | HTTP/WebSocket | AMQP-over-WS      | Only when `OPENSERVICEBUS__WEBSOCKETS__ENABLED=true`              |

You must publish `5400` (or remap it to another host port — `-p 8080:5400` works) for the
Explorer to be reachable. The internal port is always `5400`; the host port is up to you.

## One-shot run

```bash
docker run -d --name openservicebus \
  -p 5672:5672 -p 5300:5300 -p 5400:5400 \
  -v osb-data:/data \
  mauritsarissen/openservicebus:latest
```

Then:

- Point the Azure SDK at:
  ```text
  Endpoint=sb://localhost:5672;SharedAccessKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey;SharedAccessKey=SAS_KEY_VALUE;UseDevelopmentEmulator=true
  ```
- Open the Explorer at <http://localhost:5400>.
- Hit `/health` at <http://localhost:5300/health>.

## Reference `docker-compose.yml`

The richer setup most projects end up wanting: persistent volume, mounted `config.json`
that declares queues + topics + subscriptions + forwarding, broker + Explorer both
reachable.

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  openservicebus:
    image: mauritsarissen/openservicebus:latest
    container_name: openservicebus
    ports:
      - "5672:5672"      # AMQP — Service Bus SDK connects here
      - "5300:5300"      # REST management API + /health
      - "5400:5400"      # Explorer UI — open http://localhost:5400
    environment:
      OPENSERVICEBUS__STORAGE__MODE: Sqlite
      OPENSERVICEBUS__STORAGE__DATASOURCE: /data/broker.db
      OPENSERVICEBUS_CONFIG: /etc/openservicebus/config.json
    volumes:
      - osb-data:/data
      - ./config.json:/etc/openservicebus/config.json:ro
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  osb-data:
```

`docker compose up -d` and you've got the broker + Explorer + persistent storage in one
shot.

## Reference `config.json`

The mounted file the compose example points at. Declares the common Service Bus shapes:
plain queues, session-enabled queues, queues with duplicate detection, topics with
subscriptions and SQL/correlation filter rules, and auto-forwarding chains.

> **Note about DLQs.** You don't declare dead-letter queues here — every queue and every
> subscription **automatically** gets a `<entity>/$DeadLetterQueue` sibling created by the
> broker. Just receive from that address when you need to drain it.

        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

What this gives you on startup:

- **5 queues** — `orders`, `tenant-events` (session-enabled), `deduped-ingress` (dedup
  on), `audit-archive`, `ingress-gateway` (every send to it auto-forwards to
  `audit-archive`).
- **1 topic** `events` with **4 subscriptions** — `all` (`$Default` `TrueFilter` —
  receives everything), `eu-orders` (SQL filter), `high-priority` (correlation filter),
  `archive-bridge` (forwards everything matching `$Default` to `audit-archive`).
- **9 implicit DLQs** — one per queue, one per subscription — addressable as
  `<entity>/$DeadLetterQueue`. No declaration needed.

Open the Explorer at <http://localhost:5400> to see the full topology, send test
messages, and watch them route through filters and forwarding chains in real time.

## Persistence

The container persists messages **only if** you mount `/data`. Without a volume the DB
file is inside the container layer and disappears when the container is removed. With a
named volume (`-v osb-data:/data` or compose `volumes:`), the same `broker.db` is reused
across recreates — proven by an end-to-end test: send a message via the SDK, `docker stop
&& docker rm`, `docker run` from the same volume, the SDK receives the same message.

> ⚠️ Queue **descriptors** (LockDuration, MaxDeliveryCount, RequiresSession, etc.) are
> reset to defaults on restart because the in-memory registry rebuilds from the store's
> queue names only. **Always declare per-queue settings in `config.json`** so they
> survive restarts. The bootstrap service runs before rehydration.

See [Persistence](Persistence) for the SQLite schema and restart semantics.

## Healthcheck

The image declares a healthcheck against `/health` (the broker's, on port 5300):

```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=15s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD wget -q -O /dev/null http://127.0.0.1:5300/health || exit 1
```

`docker ps` reports `healthy` / `unhealthy` based on whether the broker can serve HTTP —
useful for compose health gates and Kubernetes readiness probes.

## How the container runs two apps

The image bakes both `OpenServiceBus.Host` (the broker) and `OpenServiceBus.Explorer` (the
UI) and starts them under a small POSIX-safe entrypoint script. Both processes share the
same container lifecycle: SIGTERM from `docker stop` flows to both, and if either one
crashes the container exits non-zero so your orchestrator can restart it.

The Explorer talks to the broker over loopback (`127.0.0.1:5300` for the management API,
`127.0.0.1:5672` for AMQP), so they're tightly coupled by design — there's no benefit to
running them in separate containers.

## Building locally

The repo's [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/mauritsarissen/OpenServiceBus/blob/main/Dockerfile)
is the same one the release pipeline uses:

```bash
docker build -t openservicebus:dev .
docker run --rm -p 5672:5672 -p 5300:5300 -p 5400:5400 openservicebus:dev
```

The build is layer-cache friendly — `.csproj` files copied first for restore, source
second for compile. Cold build: ~30s. Warm rebuild (source-only edit): a few seconds.
