/// Resolves "where should this message actually land?" against the entity registries.

///   1. Topic fan-out - a topic isn't a queue, so a send to a topic must evaluate every
///      subscription's rules and enqueue to the matching backing queues.
///   2. Auto-forwarding (M16) - a queue or subscription with <c>ForwardTo</c> set is a
///      transparent passthrough: the original destination never accumulates messages, the
///      router redirects to the configured destination, chaining up to <see cref="MaxForwardDepth"/> hops.
///
/// One method covers both. Senders (queue, topic, even the DLQ writers) call
/// <see cref="RouteAsync"/> with the *configured* destination name and let the router work
/// out the actual storage operations. <see cref="MessageFilterContext"/> is only used when
/// the chain passes through a topic; pass <c>null</c> for direct queue sends.
